## Passions in Life

<img class="ui tiny left circular floated image" src="../images/javascript.png">

Every little kid growing up is asked the question, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" My answer every time - Software Engineer. No, I'm just kidding. What kind of kid wants to be a software engineer? Most kids probably don't even know what a software engineer is. I certainly didn't. Throughout my childhood, I found myself aspiring to be a lot of different things. Sports was a big part of my life as a child, so naturally I wanted to be a professional athlete. Unfortunately, I barely had the talent to compete on a high school level, so that dream was shot down. While I was in elementary school, I started to study music and experimented with differnt instruments. I fell in love with the drums and became a drummer. At that point in my life, I wanted to become a professional drummer one day. Music and drumming are still a huge part of my life, but it turned into more of a hobby than an aspiring profession. The same happened when I picked up surfing in middle school. All I could think about was surfing. I worked hard to get better and I was dedicated to becoming the best I could be. But, like my music career, surfing became more of a hobby over the years. Looking back that these periods of my life, I can see how my passions for sports, music, and the ocean have grown together.

## What's Your Major?

I remember the time of my life every high school graduate and future college student goes through. The question goes from "What do you want to be?" to "What do you want to major in?" This was one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made. I though about my passions: sports, music, and surfing. How could I do something related to those passions? It seemed impossible, and scary at the time. Would my parents accept my decision? I contemplated majoring in chemistry just because I was "good at it." This was the plan for the entire summer going into my first year of college. I would study chemistry (miserably) and get my degree, go into some sort of medical or pharmaceutical school, and become a doctor. That'll show 'em.

It wasn't until the week before my freshman year in college when I realized my plan was a bad idea. Why would I do something for the sake of being "good", when I can rather do something that I love every single day. At this time, my older brother suggested I'd give computer science a try. His exact words: "Computer science is not for everyone. You either get it or you don't." I took this as a challenge and enrolled into my first computer science class at Santa Clara University.

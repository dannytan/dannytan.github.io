## Teamwork Makes the Dreamwork

As computer programmers, working in a group is of the norm. Having the ability to compliment and cooperate with other members of a group is essential. Configuration management allows for programmers and engineers to effectively complete large and complex software systems. It also allows for easy maintenance of the system. As a student of computer science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I wonder why the use of git and GitHub isn't taught and implemented in courses from the very first introductory computer science class. So far in my academic career, I have done a few group projects in my lower division computer science classes. However, since we were not introduced to configuration management tools, such as git and GitHub, sharing and writing programs as a group was extremely difficult. We would have to email each other our files separately, edit them, then send them back. We would also have to physically meet with other group members often to review and test our code. This method of project development felt extremely primitive. I constantly thought to myself, "There has to be a better way."

Through these struggles without using proper configuration management, I can understand how helpful open source and version control systems can be. Not to say I won't encounter problems using GitHub, but it will help to make group work flow much more efficiently. Although I am still considered a "newbie" to both git and GitHub, the process of learning how to use them has been an enlightening experience so far. Currently using the GitHub desktop application, I also hope to get more experience using the command line to update and manage future projects.

## What's Next?

Configuration management has evolved over the years, and git has emerged as the most popular version control system in the industry today. Personally, I think the popularity of GitHub as a cloud hosting service for git repositories is the reason git has become so popular. It's hard to say what type of version control system will be the next 'big thing' (if I did, I would write it down and patent it), assuming configuration management will continue to evolve in the future. However, with the widespread use of git and GitHub today, it doesn't look like they're going away anytime soon.

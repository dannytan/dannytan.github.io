This sticker book was designed and implemented using Java and EZ Graphics (created by Dylan Kobayashi). The user is given four different sticker options to paste on the background. Each sticker can be pasted multiple times, moved, and removed from the screen. There is also the options to save the current screen, load a previously saved screen, and clear the screen. This project was done to practice simple GUI design and Java implementation.

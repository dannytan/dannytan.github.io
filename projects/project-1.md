This program was developed for my ICS 211 class as the final project for the course. I worked individually to design, implement, and test the game. Various data structures learned in the class was used to produce this game. EZ Graphics was used to design the layout for this version of Minesweeper.

The game includes three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard.  When the easy mode is selected, the user is presented with a 10x10 grid. The medium mode is played with a 15x15 grid, and the hard mode is played with a 20x20 grid. There is a "start over" option which allows the player to restart if necessary. If the player wins, their time is recorded and displayed.  There is also a highscore list for each difficulty.  After each game, the player is asked if he/she wants to play again.

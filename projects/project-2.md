Boundless is a Christian Rock EP Album written and arranged by the Impact Fellowship worship band. All three songs were recorded in a live setting and produced by Zeo Music Studio. I was responsible for arranging and performing the drum part to each song, and also helped in the lyric writing process. 

These songs were created and released to share how music can be a tool to restore, heal, and connect people to God in their own way. The heart behind every word and melody is a testament to the faithfulness and goodness of the Lord, and is intended for both believers and non-believers.
